## Project Requirements

The Final Team Project for this course will assess the application of computer vision introduced in this course. You will be assigned to a group/team by your instructor. You and your teammate(s) will work closely to brainstorm a problem, find a dataset, clean and pre-process it, and perform a computer vision project on the data using Python. For this project, you will use Python in Google Colab, write a technical report, and prepare a recorded video presentation, including visuals based on your report.

When you finish this project, you will have a meaningful experience that you can describe in the future. If the project were something simple, like putting together a jigsaw puzzle or following a recipe exactly, every step would be determined, and you would simply need to do the steps in order. A better learning experience, just like a great story, will include a challenge to overcome and the story of what you tried to meet the challenge. When thinking about a project, choose one that you will be able to explain well in the end, not just to your instructor but to other people in the future. When you do tell the story of your project, **Situation, Task, Action, and Results (STAR)** is a good format for answering interview questions.

## Extra Credit (Optional Approach)

Read the **AAI-521 Final Project: Extra Credit** instructions, if desired. For a greater challenge, an alternative option for the final project is developing an AI system that restores and enhances old, damaged, or low-resolution images using generative AI models. The system will leverage pre-trained models from Hugging Face to perform tasks, such as:

- Image Denoising
- Image Super-Resolution
- Image Colorization
- Image Inpainting

---

## Deliverables Due

By **Day 7 of Module 7**, the designated **Team Submitter** will gather all the team's project files and links, update a Final Deliverable Inventory Word doc, and submit all in a single submission attempt.

---

### Deliverable 1: Final Report

The Final Report is a professional-level paper that communicates your project methods and findings to a technical audience; and is comprised of four structural elements:

1. **Cover** - 1 page
2. **Paper** - 7-10 written pages; double-spaced, 12 pt. font
3. **Appendix** - no page limit
4. **References** - 1 page

The 7-10 page write-up should present a narrative of your computer vision project, method, and findings. The written report should summarize your approach, methods, and procedures, and provide an explanation of your analyses and interpretations. The 7-10 written pages can include selected tables/graphs, but utilize in-text references for supporting project artifacts that you will include in the Appendix. Your audience should be able to easily locate supporting project artifacts in the Appendix. The Appendix can include code notebooks, comments, and results; and/or additional figures and images that support the narrative and findings in your Technical Report.

Your Final Report should demonstrate **APA 7 style and formatting guidelines**. Refer to the sample professional paper and the writing resources linked in the Course Resources area in Canvas.

#### Final Format:

Prepare a single `.pdf` document to submit as a Final Report by combining the four structural elements—Cover page, Written Paper, References, and Appendix—into a single document (as possible). Use the naming convention `[team#]_[deliverable].pdf`. 

**For Example:**
- `Team01_FinalReport.pdf`
- `Team01_FinalReport-Appendix.pdf`

The Team Submitter will submit all project files/links and the Final Deliverable Inventory Word doc.

---

### Deliverable 2: Code

It is **REQUIRED** that you and your team use **GitHub** as a code hosting platform to manage version control and collaboration during this project. Practice professional standards for organization and submit your link with your final report and presentation.

It is also necessary to create and add a **README file** to your GitHub repository. Building web applications (using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or Python's [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) or similar) is a big advantage and valuable practice but not a requirement. It is recommended that you follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) – Style Guide for your Python code in the final project.

#### Final Format:

Prepare your codebase for submission and set share permissions on your team repo to allow instructor viewing. **Team Submitter:** For submission, paste the Github repo link in the Comments field and add the link to your Final Deliverable Inventory.

---

### Deliverable 3: Presentation

The Presentation is a **10-12 minute recorded video** of you and your teammates summarizing your technical report and findings using visuals. Your slide deck should contain the following:

1. **Cover slide** - include your team, your names and the project title
2. **Visual Content slides** - narrated by all team members presenting your project and findings. You may include a screencast to demonstrate your codebase, but you are not required to do so.
3. **Teamwork slide** - one slide to showcase your collaborative efforts; highlight each team member's individual names and their contributions to the final project work and deliverables

#### Recording Requirements:

- Use any mutually agreed upon recording method or screen-casting software for your presentation.
- Ensure that the sound quality of your video is good.
- Ensure that each member presents an equal portion of the presentation.
- You can use your USD licenses to Zoom to record your screen and provide a voice narration. View Recording Video Presentation and Submission Guidelines for AAI Students for more options and good practices.

#### Final Format:

Prepare a final `.mp4` file to submit to the assignment. You may host your video and include a viable link in your submission, but please also include the `.mp4` file. Use the naming convention: `[team#]_[deliverable].mp4` or `[team#]_[deliverable]-[component].pptx`

**For Example:**
- `Team01_Presentation-Video.mp4`
- `Team01_Presentation-Slides.pptx`

---

## Final Submission

Use the file naming conventions described in the Deliverables section.

Designate a **"Team Submitter"** to submit all files and links, and a Final Deliverable Inventory (Word doc) in a single submission attempt.

### Team Submitter:

1. Assemble the team's final files/links, and update the Final Deliverable Inventory (Word doc). Click **Start Assignment**.
2. Upload all project files and the deliverable inventory document.
3. Paste deliverable links in the Comments field.
4. Review your submission attempt to make sure all files/links are included in the submission Attempt. Click **Submit Assignment**.

> **Note:** Your instructor will only grade the files/links in the last submission.

To understand how your work will be assessed, view the scoring rubric below.

---

## Important Reminders

> **⚠️ Peer Evaluations:** You will complete Peer Evaluations individually and submit them as a separate assignment in Module 7. Team members may not get the same grade on the Final Team Project, depending on each team member's level of contribution.

> **⚠️ Plagiarism:** Plagiarism, or passing another person's code/work/answers off as one's own either by directly copying or even paraphrasing it without proper citation, is a serious offense and can result in sanctions, including grade reductions, course failures, and even expulsion from the university. For more information, please see the USD Code of Honor.

> **⚠️ Turnitin:** This assignment has Turnitin enabled for submissions which means that your instructor will obtain a Similarity Report that identifies specific parts of your writing that may indicate a high level of matching to external content. You are strongly encouraged to review your work without penalty by activating the Draft Coach extension in your Google Docs prior to submitting your work for final grading.

> **⚠️ AI-Assisted Tools:** AI-assisted tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and GitHub Copilot should be used to enhance your learning, not replace it. If you use any AI tools in your assignments, you must explicitly disclose, cite, and explain their contributions (e.g., comments in code, footnotes in reports). Submitting AI-generated code and answers without sufficient understanding, modification, and justification is not acceptable. Proper attribution is essential to maintain academic integrity across all courses and will help position you for future success in this field.
