Project Requirements
The Final Team Project for this course will assess the application of computer vision introduced in this course. You will be assigned to a group/team by your instructor. You and your teammate(s) will work closely to brainstorm a problem, find a dataset, clean and pre-process it, and perform a computer vision project on the data using Python. For this project, you will use Python in Google Colab, write a technical report, and prepare a recorded video presentation, including visuals based on your report.

When you finish this project, you will have a meaningful experience that you can describe in the future. If the project were something simple, like putting together a jigsaw puzzle or following a recipe exactly, every step would be determined, and you would simply need to do the steps in order. A better learning experience, just like a great story, will include a challenge to overcome and the story of what you tried to meet the challenge. When thinking about a project, choose one that you will be able to explain well in the end, not just to your instructor but to other people in the future. When you do tell the story of your project, Situation, Task, Action, and Results (STAR) is a good format for answering interview questions.

Technical Report and Appendix  
Code Base (GitHub repo)
Video Presentation
Project Timeline:
By Day 7 (end of the module week): 

Module 1, you will complete a Teammate Survey to inform your instructor of your group preferences. 
Module 2, you will be assigned a group of two to three members. Connect with your team members via Canvas, USD Email, or Slack. Research a dataset and project idea to introduce to your teammates. 
Module 4, your team will complete the Team Project Status Update Form and describe the dataset(s) your team has chosen. 
Module 7, your team will finalize and submit the three deliverables for the final project. 
Module 7, you will complete a Peer Review for each team member and submit in an individual assignment in Canvas.   
** No extensions will be given for any of the final project due dates for any reason. Final projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.

Project Teamwork: 
The final teamwork project is an essential component of our courses in the AAI program. This project is representative of the kind of collaborative project you may work on during your career and real-world projects. A significant portion of your final grade is drawn from your participation in this final group project, so you are strongly encouraged to work within your team and that each team member contributes equally to the final project deliverables. Team members should plan to have clear and ongoing communication with your team and engage with the project and its deliverables each week. Lack of participation and engagement with both your team and your final project can result in a failing grade for the course. While these are the expectations for the project work, if you do experience difficulty with project advancement or challenges with team dynamics, contact your instructor for assistance promptly.

**If you are unable to perform the project work within a team, contact your instructor your instructor no later than Day 7 of Module 3 to explore pursuing the entire final project independently.

**You will complete Peer Evaluations individually and submit them in a separate assignment link in Module 7. Team members may not get the same grade on the Final Team Project, depending on each team member's level of contribution. 

Project Datasets:
You will be responsible for finding a dataset of images for this project. Final projects and datasets from prior courses cannot be used. Several free data resources are provided by the UCI Machine Learning RepositoryLinks to an external site. and Kaggle Computer Vision DatasetsLinks to an external site.. Here are some other resources that can help you with project ideas and datasets:

Project Examples:
People counting tool: Detect and count the people in an image. You can also make it more fun by adding a Human emotion recognition in the same image, too.
Object tracking in a video: You can build simple object tracking models using videos involving one object, such as a car, or multiple objects, like pedestrians, animals, and whatnot. This can include a Hand gesture recognition application, too.
Pedestrian detection: You know one of the objectives of an autonomous vehicle job is to detect pedestrians and any other objects in the line. You can design a deep learning algorithm that makes this happen. A more advanced version of this project can include Road lane detection or Traffic light detection, too.
Instructions 
Read the AAI-521 Final Project: Instructions document for prompts to guide your project development for the following:   

Project Selection & Setup 
EDA and Pre-Processing   
Modeling Methods
Validation and Performance Metrics 
Modeling Results and Findings
In each module apply your understanding to iterate project tasks and progress on outputs.

Extra Credit (Optional Approach):
Read the AAI-521 Final Project: Extra Credit instructions, if desired. For a greater challenge, an alternative option for the final project is developing an AI system that restores and enhances old, damaged, or low-resolution images using generative AI models. The system will leverage pre-trained models from Hugging Face to perform tasks, such as Image Denoising, Image Super-Resolution, Image Colorization, and Image Inpainting.

Deliverables Due  
By Day 7 of Module 7, the designated Team Submitter will gather all the team's project files and links, update a Final Deliverable Inventory Word doc, and submit all in a single submission attempt. 

Deliverable 1: Final Report
The Final Report is a professional-level paper that communicates your project methods and findings to a technical audience; and is comprised of four structural elements:

Cover - 1 page
Paper - 7-10 written pages; double-spaced, 12 pt. font
Appendix - no page limit
References - 1 page
The 7-10 page write-up should present a narrative of your computer vision project, method, and findings. The written report should summarize your approach, methods, and procedures, and provide an explanation of your analyses and interpretations. The 7-10 written pages can include selected tables/graphs, but utilize in-text references for supporting project artifacts that you will include in the Appendix. Your audience should be able to easily locate supporting project artifacts in the Appendix. The Appendix can include code notebooks, comments, and results; and/or additional figures and images that support the narrative and findings in your Technical Report. 

Your Final Report should demonstrate APA 7 style and formatting guidelines. Refer to the sample professional paper and the writing resources linked in the Course Resources area in Canvas.

Final Format:

Prepare a single .pdf document to submit as a Final Report by combining the four structural elements—Cover page, Written Paper, References, and Appendix—into a single document (as possible). Use the naming convention [team#]_[deliverable].pdf. For Example: 

Team01_FinalReport.pdf
Team01_FinalReport-Appendix.pdf
The Team Submitter will submit all project files/links and the Final Deliverable Inventory Word doc. 

Deliverable 2: Code
It is REQUIRED that you and your team use GitHub as a code hosting platform to manage version control and collaboration during this project. Practice professional standards for organization and submit your link with your final report and presentation. 

It also necessary to create and add a README file to your GitHub repository. Building web applications (using StreamlitLinks to an external site. or Python’s DashLinks to an external site. or similar) is a big advantage and valuable practice but not a requirement. It is recommended that you follow the PEP 8Links to an external site. – Style Guide for your Python code in the final project. 

Final Format:

Prepare your codebase for submission and set share permissions on your team repo to allow instructor viewing. Team Submitter: For submission, paste the Github repo link in the Comments field and add the link to your Final Deliverable Inventory.   

Deliverable 3: Presentation 
The Presentation is a 10-12 minute recorded video of you and your teammates summarizing your technical report and findings using visuals. Your slide deck should contain the following:  

Cover slide - include your team, your names and the project title 
Visual Content slides - narrated by all team members presenting your project and findings. You may include a screencast to demonstrate your codebase, but you are not required to do so.  
Teamwork slide - one slide to showcase your collaborative efforts; highlight each team member's individual names and their contributions to the final project work and deliverables
Recording Requirements: 

Use any mutually agreed upon recording method or screen-casting software for your presentation.  
Ensure that the sound quality of your video is good.
Ensure that each member presents an equal portion of the presentation.
You can use your USD licenses to Zoom to record your screen and provide a voice narration. View Recording Video Presentation and Submission Guidelines for AAI Students for more options and good practices.
Final Format: 

Prepare a final .mp4 file to submit to the assignment. You may host your video and include a viable link in your submission, but please also include the  .mp4 file. Use the naming convention:  [team#]_[deliverable].mp4 or [team#]_[deliverable]-[component].pptx
